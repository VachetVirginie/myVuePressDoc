# emojisinvuepressmarkdown


VuePress includes emojis as part of its Markdown extensions. You include them in your text by surrounding an emoji code with colon characters. For example, you'd use `:smile:` for 😄, or `:thumbsup:` for 👍.

Here is a table with some common emojis. For the full list of supported codes see the [Emoji Cheat Sheet](https://www.webpagefx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/)
